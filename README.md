# ModView
This application will input meshes and display them in a PBR (or custom) lighting and material model.
This is mainly a 3D renderer with a "sandbox" application to view 3D models at runtime under lighting conditions.

This is mainly more of a fun project for me personally as well as learning how a 3D renderer may work.
